# 📚 Library Management System in Python

A beginner-friendly **Library Management System** built using core Python concepts and text files. This project simulates the borrowing and returning of books, records user information, and maintains a history of transactions — all through a simple command-line interface (CLI).

---

## 🧠 Motivation

Libraries have long played a crucial role in education. This project offers a basic simulation of library operations without requiring complex databases or frameworks. It is **designed for beginners** to practice Python basics such as:
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- File handling (`.txt`)
- Conditional logic & control flow
- User input validation
- Working with simple text-based menus

## 🎯 Features

✅ Borrow a Book  
✅ Return a Book  
✅ View All Borrow/Return Records  
✅ Read available books from `books.txt`  
✅ Store transaction logs in `records.txt`  
✅ Menu-driven CLI interface  
✅ Error handling for missing files
