# Code of Conduct

Hi there! 👋

This is a personal project, but I want to keep things positive and respectful if others ever interact—whether it's through feedback, issues, or contributions.

## 💬 Constructive Feedback

Suggestions and ideas are always welcome—but be constructive, not critical. Let's help each other grow.

## 🙅‍♀️ No Harassment

Absolutely no discrimination, harassment, or personal attacks of any kind. Let's keep things safe and friendly for everyone.

## 🙌 Respect Boundaries

This is a learning and creative space. If I don’t merge a PR or accept a suggestion, please understand—it’s nothing personal.

## 📩 Contact

If there’s ever a problem, you can reach me through GitHub or email (add your email or preferred contact method here).

Thanks for being awesome! 😊
